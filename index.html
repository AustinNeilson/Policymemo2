                            <p class="text-white-50">Children with parents in prison suffer greatly from mental health problems and lack of role models in their lives. They are at a massive disadvantage because they lack the learning and growing experiences that parents provide. Team sports have shown to positively impact the mental health of these children. Team sports can act as an outlet for these children to learn skills that they otherwise wouldnt learn, and also provides them with sources of role models that can shape their future. </p>
                            <p class="text-white-50">“Put Me In” is an organization that specializes in providing the money necessary for children with incarcerated parents to enroll in team sports as well as obtain the gear needed to enjoy the sport.</p> 
                            <p class="text-white-50">The organization is currently located in the San Francisco, Minneapolis, Austin and Boston areas. They are currently supporting over 50 children and helping them receive the outlet they need to be successful in life.</p>
                            <p class="text-white-50">Put Me In provides $1,000 annually for the each of the children’s sports programs as well as the equipment needed to participate in the activities. The organization also provides the children and their parents with the information necessary to find their desired sports activities in their areas.</p>

                            <p class="text-white mb-4">In the Impact report provided by "Put Me In" they provide a case study on J.<br> J is a child that is currently enrolled in the program and is seeing rapid growth in his social and academic life.</p>
                            <p>J has improved 4 reading levels since joining the program. His mom has expressed her gratitude for the program saying,<br> "I just love seeing how he transforms, and it is such a beautiful growing process<br> because not only is his confidence boosting, but his self-worth is also growing because he knows if he applies himself, he can accomplish this."</p>
                            <p>This case study demonstrates a perfect example of how "Put Me In" can change the current lives of these children, and how it is helping them shape their future.<br> J's life has improved drastically and has been a blessing to him as well as his mother. How many other children are out there waiting for this same life-line?</p>
